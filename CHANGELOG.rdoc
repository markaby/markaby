= 0.5
=== 03 October, 2006

* XHTML Validation built in.  So, if you have an invalid tag: error.  Invalid attribute: error.
  And two identical IDs in the same document: error.  Optional, of course.  But handy!
* New Markaby::Fragment class adds much flexibility.  If it discovers you are using a tag as a string,
  the tag is removed from the stream.  (<tt>div { strong("Real") + " Giraffes" }</tt>)
* The prevailing rule now is: if you want it escaped, pass it as an arg.  If not, pass it to a block.
* Again, escaped: <tt>h1("Me & You Have a Giraffe")</tt>
* And, not escaped: <tt>h1 { "<a href='/'>Home</a>" }</tt>
* Less method_missing, meaning: faster calls all around.  Tag methods generated based on doctype.
* The <tt>html</tt> method doesn't write the doctype tags and meta tags.  You must use <tt>xhtml_transitional</tt> or <tt>xhtml_strict</tt> methods to do that.
* The <tt>img</tt> method doesn't try to inject an empty alt tag and a zero border.  No more of that.
